### 2. Project Overview (3 minutes)
**What is Envoy Daily Briefing?**

- **Core Concept**: React-based web application that uses AI to curate and present workplace-relevant news
- **Target Audience**: Busy executives, managers, and business professionals

- Architecture: Single-page application with real-time updates

### 3. Deep Dive - Technical Implementation (5 minutes)
**How the Magic Happens**

**The Two Core Files**:

1. **`fetchDailyNews.ts`** - The AI Orchestrator
   ```typescript
   // Uses OpenAI's web search to find current news
   // Validates publication dates are TODAY
   // Ensures 6 different categories, 6 different sources
   // Returns structured JSON with headlines, summaries, bullets, citations
   ```

2. **`App.tsx`** - The Experience Layer
   ```typescript
   // Auto-rotating carousel (20-second intervals)
   // Real-time relative timestamps ("2 hours ago")
   // Responsive design with gradient backgrounds
   // Loading states and error handling
   ```

**AI Integration Highlights**:
- **Structured JSON Schema**: Ensures reliable data parsing
